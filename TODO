## 1.0.0
- bundle
- replace components



## Merge Requirements
- datepicker tests pass
- tests run via circle

## Next
- set sem rel token
- tsc
- full eslint
- press apps are a class?
- npm exports function/browser runs automatically


## Thoughts


submit models instead of names
stop using switches
warn on apps within apps
create non-form app


docs should explain how to use jsdelivr styles
npm version of style.css should not resolve @import

input test
full eslint
tsc
make custom components optional

log aggressively in non-prod mode
make it easy to disable phases in dev mode
create a map of v-model -> form names for use at submission
remove todos
